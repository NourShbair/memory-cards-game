## UX

The design of **Memory Game** is centered around simplicity and fun, with a focus on providing an engaging and enjoyable user experience. Here’s a brief overview of my design process:

**Simple and Colorful Aesthetic:** The overall design is intentionally kept minimal yet vibrant to complement the playful nature of the game. A colorful palette was chosen to make the game visually appealing, ensuring that it matches the energetic concept of flipping and matching cards.

**Home Page (Game Interface):** The home page serves as the core of the game. It features the memory card game in a clean and clutter-free layout. The cards are displayed with enough space between them to avoid confusion, and the simple design keeps the focus on the game itself. Each card flip is animated smoothly to enhance the user experience.

**404 Error Page:** For the 404 page, I designed a fun and lighthearted screen that aligns with the theme of the game. Instead of a generic error page, I created a quirky and colorful message that engages the user and encourages them to return to the game.

**Responsive Design:** The design is fully responsive, ensuring that the game can be enjoyed on different screen sizes and devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

This approach allowed me to create a visually engaging yet simple interface that fits the game’s playful concept while maintaining a smooth and user-friendly experience.
